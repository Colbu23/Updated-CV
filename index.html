          <td>I was an active portfolio management in the region of Transylvania (Cluj, Brasov and Oradea). I did market research, identified potential clients, contact them and negotiated offers. I was responsible for adequate promotion of our assets, organizing and holding auctions (bidding strategies and regulations), asset management and forecasting sales. I was involved in both office work and traveling, for active presentation or meeting customers. It was a great experience that allowed me to learn a different selling procedure, for a wide range of products starting from cars, machinery, small real estate properties to entire factories, industrial platforms and even farms. It also provided me with the opportunity to negotiate with high profile customers and better understand the business world and problems businesses face.</td>
